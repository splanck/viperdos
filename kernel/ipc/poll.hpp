 * @file poll.hpp
 * @brief Polling and timer primitives for cooperative task scheduling.
 *
 * @details
 * The poll subsystem provides:
 * - A `poll()` function for checking readiness of multiple handles (channels,
 *   timers, and pseudo-handles like console input).
 * - A simple timer facility used to implement sleep and timeouts.
 *
 * The design is intentionally simple for early bring-up:
 * - Polling is implemented as a loop that checks readiness and yields.
 * - Timers are stored in a fixed-size table.
 * - Time is measured in milliseconds using the system tick counter.
