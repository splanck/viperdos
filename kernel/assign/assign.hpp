/**
 * @file assign.hpp
 * @brief "Assign" name-to-directory mapping system (v0.2.0).
 *
 * @details
 * The Assign system provides a user-facing way to refer to filesystem locations
 * using short logical prefixes, similar to "devices" or "volumes":
 *
 * - `SYS:` typically refers to the system/root directory.
 * - `D0:` refers to a boot disk or physical drive.
 *
 * Paths using assigns have the form `NAME:rest/of/path`. The prefix is resolved
 * to a directory handle, and the remainder is walked relative to that base.
 *
 * In v0.2.0 the implementation is intentionally simple:
 * - Assign names are matched case-insensitively.
 * - The backing handle type is a capability handle. During bring-up this maps
 *   directly to ViperFS inode numbers for filesystem objects.
 * - Multi-directory assigns are represented as a linked chain of entries.
 *
 * This subsystem is used by syscalls (ASSIGN_* numbers) and by higher-level
 * path resolution routines that want to support `SYS:`-style addressing.
