 * @brief Capability table implementation used by a Viper/task.
 *
 * @details
 * A capability table maps opaque handles to kernel objects along with:
 * - Object kind/type information.
 * - A rights bitmask restricting permitted operations.
 * - A generation counter for detecting stale handles after slot reuse.
 *
 * Each Viper/task can own a capability table that represents its view of kernel
 * objects. This file defines the table entry format and the `cap::Table` class
 * that manages allocation, lookup, and derivation.
