/**
 * @file wait.hpp
 * @brief Wait queue implementation for blocking/waking tasks.
 *
 * @details
 * Wait queues provide a proper mechanism for tasks to block waiting for
 * events and to be woken up when those events occur. Unlike single-task
 * pointers, wait queues support multiple waiters and provide FIFO ordering.
 *
 * ## Locking Requirements
 *
 * @warning WaitQueue operations are NOT thread-safe on their own. Callers
 * MUST hold an appropriate lock (typically a Spinlock) when calling any
 * WaitQueue function that modifies the queue state. This includes:
 * - wait_enqueue() - adds task to queue
 * - wait_dequeue() - removes task from queue
 * - wait_wake_one() - removes and wakes first task
 * - wait_wake_all() - removes and wakes all tasks
 *
 * The read-only functions wait_empty() and wait_count() should also be
 * called under the same lock if the result affects synchronization decisions.
 *
 * Typical pattern with external locking:
 * @code
 * Spinlock lock;
 * WaitQueue wq;
 *
 * // To block (producer/consumer example):
 * u64 saved_daif = lock.acquire();
 * while (buffer_empty) {
 *     wait_enqueue(&wq, task::current());
 *     lock.release(saved_daif);
 *     task::yield();  // Switch away, wake will re-acquire
 *     saved_daif = lock.acquire();
 * }
 * // ... consume from buffer ...
 * lock.release(saved_daif);
 *
 * // To wake:
 * u64 saved_daif = lock.acquire();
 * // ... produce to buffer ...
 * wait_wake_one(&wq);
 * lock.release(saved_daif);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The lock must be released BEFORE calling task::yield() but the task
 * must be enqueued BEFORE releasing the lock to avoid lost wakeups.
