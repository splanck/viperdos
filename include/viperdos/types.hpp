/**
 * @file types.hpp
 * @brief Shared fixed-width type aliases for ViperDOS kernel and user-space.
 *
 * @details
 * This header provides the fundamental fixed-width integer and size aliases
 * used throughout ViperDOS. It is designed for freestanding environments
 * and does not require the C/C++ standard library.
 *
 * Both kernel and user-space code include this header to ensure type
 * consistency across the ABI boundary.
 *
 * **Endianness**: All ABI structures in `include/viperdos/` assume
 * little-endian byte order (AArch64 default configuration). Network-byte-order
 * fields (e.g., IP/TCP headers) are explicitly converted using the helpers in
 * `kernel/lib/endian.hpp`.
 *
 * The aliases mirror common low-level systems conventions:
 * - `u*` for unsigned integers, `i*` for signed integers
 * - `usize`/`isize` for sizes and signed sizes
 * - `uintptr` for holding pointer values as integers
