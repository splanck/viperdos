 * @brief Memory mapping functions for ViperDOS libc.
 *
 * @details
 * This file implements POSIX memory mapping functions:
 *
 * - mmap/munmap: Map/unmap memory regions
 * - mprotect: Change memory protection
 * - msync: Synchronize mapped memory with backing store
 * - madvise/posix_madvise: Advise kernel about memory usage
 * - mlock/munlock: Lock/unlock memory pages
 * - shm_open/shm_unlink: Shared memory (not implemented)
 *
 * Memory mappings are managed by the kernel's virtual memory system.
 * All mappings must be page-aligned (4KB on ViperDOS).

 * Creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling process.

 * Protection flags (prot):
 * - PROT_NONE: Pages cannot be accessed
 * - PROT_READ: Pages can be read
 * - PROT_WRITE: Pages can be written
 * - PROT_EXEC: Pages can be executed
 *
 * Mapping flags (flags):
 * - MAP_SHARED: Updates visible to other processes mapping the same region
 * - MAP_PRIVATE: Copy-on-write private mapping
 * - MAP_FIXED: Place mapping at exactly the specified address
 * - MAP_ANONYMOUS: Not backed by any file (fd is ignored)
 *
 * For file mappings, the fd argument is an open file descriptor. The offset
 * argument specifies where in the file the mapping begins.
 *
 * @param addr Preferred address for the mapping (or NULL for kernel choice).
 * @param length Length of the mapping in bytes (rounded up to page size).
 * @param prot Memory protection (PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, PROT_EXEC).
 * @param flags Mapping type and options (MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE, etc.).
 * @param fd File descriptor for file mapping (ignored if MAP_ANONYMOUS).
 * @param offset Offset in the file (must be page-aligned).
 * @return Pointer to mapped area on success, or MAP_FAILED on error.
