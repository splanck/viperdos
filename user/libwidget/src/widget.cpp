/**
 * @file widget.c
 * @brief Core widget system implementation for the libwidget toolkit.
 *
 * This file contains the fundamental widget operations that form the backbone
 * of the libwidget GUI toolkit. It implements:
 *
 * - **Widget Lifecycle**: Creation, initialization, and destruction of widgets
 * - **Geometry Management**: Position and size manipulation functions
 * - **Widget Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships and tree traversal
 * - **Event Handling**: Mouse click and keyboard event dispatch
 * - **Focus Management**: Keyboard focus tracking across widget trees
 * - **Rendering Pipeline**: Paint dispatch and child rendering
 * - **Application Framework**: Complete event loop with GUI integration
 *
 * ## Architecture Overview
 *
 * The widget system uses a tree-based hierarchy where each widget can have
 * multiple children. Events are dispatched using a bubbling model where
 * child widgets are given first opportunity to handle events (in reverse
 * z-order for correct visual layering).
 *
 * The rendering pipeline works top-down: parents paint first, then children
 * are painted on top. This allows container widgets to draw backgrounds
 * that children will appear over.
 *
 * ## Memory Management
 *
 * Widgets own their children. When a parent is destroyed, all descendants
 * are recursively destroyed. The widget_destroy() function handles this
 * automatically, including removing the widget from its parent's child list.
 *
 * ## Coordinate System
 *
 * All widget coordinates are in absolute window coordinates. When handling
 * events like mouse clicks, the coordinates are transformed to widget-local
 * coordinates before being passed to callbacks (by subtracting widget origin).
 *
 * @see widget.h for public API declarations
 * @see layout.c for automatic widget positioning
 * @see Individual widget type files (button.c, textbox.c, etc.) for specific implementations

// Keycode to character conversion
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//

/**
 * @brief Converts an evdev keycode to its corresponding ASCII character.
 *
 * This function translates Linux evdev keyboard scancodes into printable
 * ASCII characters. It handles the standard US QWERTY keyboard layout
 * including letters, numbers, and common punctuation marks.
 *
 * The evdev keycode values used are:
 * - **Q-P row**: keycodes 16-25 → "qwertyuiop"
 * - **A-L row**: keycodes 30-38 → "asdfghjkl"
 * - **Z-M row**: keycodes 44-50 → "zxcvbnm"
 * - **Number row**: keycodes 2-10 → '1'-'9', keycode 11 → '0'
 * - **Special keys**: keycode 57 → space, 12 → '-'/'_', 13 → '='/'+'
 * - **Punctuation**: keycode 52 → '.'/'>', keycode 51 → ','/'<'
 *
 * The function respects the shift modifier for:
 * - Uppercase letters (a-z → A-Z)
 * - Number row symbols (1-0 → !@#$%^&*())
 * - Punctuation alternatives (- → _, = → +, . → >, , → <)
 *
 * @param keycode  The evdev keycode to convert. Valid keycodes are those
 *                 listed above; other keycodes result in a null character.
 * @param modifiers Modifier key bitmask. Bit 0 (value 1) indicates shift
 *                  is held, which affects the output character.
 *
 * @return The ASCII character corresponding to the keycode, or '\0' (null)
 *         if the keycode doesn't map to a printable character.
 *
 * @note This function only handles a subset of the keyboard. Control keys,
 *       function keys, navigation keys, and other special keys are not
 *       translated and will return '\0'.
 *
 * @note The evdev keycodes used here are Linux-standard values that differ
 *       from USB HID scancodes and Windows virtual key codes.
 *
 * @see widget_handle_key() Uses this to provide character data to key handlers

 * to ensure consistent initialization across all widget types.
 *
 * The initialization process:
 * 1. Zeros the entire widget structure using memset
 * 2. Sets the widget type identifier
 * 3. Establishes parent relationship
 * 4. Sets default visibility to true (widgets are visible by default)
 * 5. Sets default enabled state to true (widgets are interactive by default)
 * 6. Applies default colors (light gray background, black foreground)
 * 7. Adds this widget to the parent's child list (if parent is not NULL)
 *
 * @param w      Pointer to the widget structure to initialize. Must point to
 *               already-allocated memory of at least sizeof(widget_t) bytes.
 * @param type   The type of widget being created (WIDGET_BUTTON, WIDGET_LABEL, etc.).
 *               This determines how the widget is rendered and how it handles events.
 * @param parent Optional parent widget. If non-NULL, this widget is automatically
 *               added to the parent's child list. Pass NULL for root widgets.
 *
 * @note This function assumes `w` points to valid, allocated memory.
 *       The caller is responsible for memory allocation.
 *
 * @note The memset to zero ensures all pointers (children, callbacks, user_data)
 *       start as NULL and all counts start at zero.

 * @see button_create(), textbox_create(), etc. for type-specific creation

 * require additional type-specific data. For standard widget types like
 * buttons, labels, or textboxes, use the type-specific creation functions
 * (button_create(), label_create(), etc.) which allocate the correct
 * structure size and perform additional initialization.
 *
 * The created widget has the following default properties:
 * - **Visible**: true (widget will be rendered)
 * - **Enabled**: true (widget will respond to events)
 * - **Geometry**: (0, 0, 0, 0) - position and size are zero
 * - **Colors**: Light gray background, black foreground
 * - **Focus**: Not focused
 * - **Callbacks**: All NULL (no event handlers)
 * - **Children**: Empty (no child widgets)

 *               for top-level widgets (like root containers).

 *
 * The destruction process performs these steps in order:
 * 1. **Parent Removal**: If the widget has a parent, it is removed from

 *    freed memory after destruction.
 * 2. **Child Destruction**: All child widgets are recursively destroyed.
 *    This ensures the entire subtree is cleaned up.

 * 4. **Memory Release**: The widget structure itself is freed.

 *          cause undefined behavior. Instead, mark widgets for deletion
 *          and destroy them after the event loop iteration completes.

 * ## Rendering
 * - Performs initial paint before entering the loop
 * - Repaints after each event that returns "handled"
 *
 * ## CPU Yielding
 * - Executes a yield syscall (SVC #0 with x8=0x0E) after each iteration
 *   to allow other processes to run
 *
 * The function returns when:
 * - The window close button is clicked (GUI_EVENT_CLOSE)
 * - widget_app_quit() is called from an event handler
 *
 * @param app Pointer to the widget application. If NULL, returns immediately.
 *
 * @note This function blocks until the application exits. All event handling
 *       happens within this function.
 *
 * @note Event handlers (on_click, on_key, etc.) are called synchronously
 *       from within this function. Long-running handlers will block the
 *       event loop and make the UI unresponsive.
 *
 * @see widget_app_quit() To exit the event loop programmatically
 * @see widget_app_repaint() Called to refresh the display after events
